				<li>Inside listsandlinks create a file called "index.html" and a file called "main.css"</li>
				<li>In index.html create an ordered list of step by step instructions to create a new webpage on the production server.</li>
				<li>Also create an unordered list of 5 or more links to websites with useful webdesign related information.</li>

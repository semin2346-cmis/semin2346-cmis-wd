			Your arrival is much appreciated. Buy candy.

		<header>
			Welcome to my Web Design Final Project commerce website. It has been forged with the tears of dying students and the essence of tomatoes. Have fun.
		</header>
		<p>
			This is a commerce website where candy is sold. Last-minute party? Disappointed children/guests? Just a pure, indolent, yet indiscribably strong desire for candy? Look no further. Order all sorts of candy with the click of your synthetic touchpad here. This website offers packets of one type of candy to fulfill your heart's content of blue gummy bears, bulk candy for any occasion, from Halloween to Hannukah, or just piles of chocolate. Indulge your weary self with mountains of granulated sugar melted at different temperatures and colored with artificial food coloring!
